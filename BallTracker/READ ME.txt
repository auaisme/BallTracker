DEVELOPED BY: Ali Usman

-----------------------------------

TECHNOLOGIES:
	Backend: SpringBoot
	Frontend: THREE.JS + Bootstrap + Fundamental JS and CSS
	Websockets: Stomp over SockJS
	Database: MySQL 8
	IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

-----------------------------------

HOW TO RUN:
	Set-up database: If you're using a dbms other than MySQL8, you need to update application.yaml and all other relevant code to reflect your database. If you're using a custom configuration of MySQL8, you also need to update application.yaml to reflect that.

	Internet connection: Since many JS files are included on run-time, you need to ensure that you have a stable internet connection, or include said JS files into to the project manually.

	Running and accessing: First start the system through IntelliJ IDEA then head on over to localhost:8080 to access the frontend.

	Refer to video on how to use: https://www.loom.com/share/4e157c3690a54236bee5906dfd94d87e?sid=8a305ff5-f165-4ec1-86be-19281916e6d1

-----------------------------------

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
	A password system can be implemented, however, as the project doesn't contain any sensitive data, there was no apparent need for it. Since there is only 1 role, Ball Monitor, there was no need to explicitly declare the role either. These can and will be changed in the future.

-----------------------------------

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND:
	If you're making any changes to the system, you must ensure that it works properly. Please update the application.yaml and any and all comments when making changes.

	MySQL Configuration:
		Username: root
		Password: admin
		MySQL 8 was left on default configuration, however, please confirm that your configuration matches that of application.yaml
